                TREATMENT</p>
            <div id="mission-desc">
                <p>
                    Since 1991 we are providing health care services to the Poor & neglected Sex Workers,
                    Poor People Living
                    with HIV & their Children for the Prevention & Treatment, enlightening about human & legal rights to
                    fight against injustice. Vocational training has brought radical change in their life given up the
                    prostitution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The education to the children of sex workers & marginalized people has transformed the life pattern
                    of
                    them. Because of education child prostitution, human trafficking has been stopped & the children of
                    marginalized people have secured better education, employment, personality development & joined the
                    mainstream of the society. Their future will be brighter & they will live happily with their single
                    mothers & poor parents. Education will make them responsible citizen of the country & they will
                    perform
                    the work of nation building. Hence there is absolute need of funding support from your good selves.
